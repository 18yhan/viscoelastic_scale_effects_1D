At a% particular depth point, j, the stiffness tensor is c(6,6,j).  % Note that the output stiffness array is 3-dimensional.  If an application% requires a 2-dimensional array at a single depth point, then use Matlab% function SQUEEZE, e.g.  %          squeeze(c(6,6,j))% yields a 6x6 array.% The Backus average is computed in a running window, and it is assumed that the% medium consists of thin isotropic layers.%% input:   z       - Vector of depths, as in a well log.
